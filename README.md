Welcome to my Obsidian-Usage repository.

As a fresher, the world of Frontend Engineering is dazzling—it’s where code turns into visual wonders. But instead of taking the front door with standard HTML/JS tutorials (been there, done that in college, didn't catch the bug), I decided to break in through the skylight.

This is my "weird rookie entry" into frontend: an Obsidian extension.
I bypassed the "Hello World" web apps to dive straight into the deep end of plugin development. Is it the most logical path? No. Is it the curiosity-driven path? Absolutely.

This tracker is my attempt to git my life together, one green square at a time. It’s about consistency, not intensity.

This repo will serve as the tracking branch for all my Obsidian-related updates. Watch this space as I attempt to merge my chaotic learning curve into a stable main branch.
